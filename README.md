Cloud Native Show Live Episode #1 with Shayne and Glenn. They talk about Cloud Native development and build out a weather API application. First, they'll show you how to build an API with configuration and building an Azure DevOps pipeline. That pipeline will build a container image to push it to an Azure Container Registry.
